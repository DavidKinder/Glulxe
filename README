* Compiling

Since this is a Glk program, it must be built with a Glk library. See
the Glk home page at

http://www.edoc.com/zarf/glk/index.html

The Unix Makefile that comes with this package is designed to link any
of the Unix libraries (XGlk, GlkTerm, and CheapGlk.) You'll have to
go into the Makefile and set three variables to find the library. There
are instructions at the top of the Makefile. Then just type

    make glulxe

That should suffice. When the program is built, type

    ./glulxe filename.ulx

where "filename.ulx" is a Glulx game file to execute.

To build this program on a Macintosh, you'll need the MacGlk library.
See the instructions that come with that. It's fairly straightforward;
compile the library, the source code, and the "macglk_startup.c" file.
(NOTE: Except that I haven't written a "macglk_startup.c" file yet.)

* Version

This is a pre-release version. It's not anywhere close to complete yet.
It doesn't deserve a version number. If it had one, it would be 0.20.

* Permissions

You may copy and distribute it freely, by any means and under any
conditions, as long as the code and documentation is not changed. You
